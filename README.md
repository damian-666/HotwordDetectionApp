# HotwordDetectionApp


1.	Keyword Spotting: This technique involves training a machine learning model to recognize specific keywords or hotwords. The model is trained on a large dataset of audio samples containing the desired hotwords. Once trained, the model can be used to detect the presence of the hotwords in real-time audio streams.
2.	Energy-Based Detection: This technique involves analyzing the energy level of the audio signal to detect the presence of a hotword. It typically involves setting a threshold energy level and comparing it to the energy level of the incoming audio. If the energy level exceeds the threshold, it is considered a potential hotword.
3.	Spectral Analysis: This technique involves analyzing the frequency content of the audio signal to detect specific patterns associated with hotwords. It often involves using techniques such as Fourier Transform or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to extract relevant features from the audio. Machine learning models can then be trained on these features to perform hotword detection.

    }

4.	Hidden Markov Models (HMM): HMMs are statistical models that can be used for hotword detection. They model the probability distribution of the audio signal and the transitions between different states. By training an HMM on a dataset of audio samples containing hotwords, it can be used to detect the presence of hotwords in real-time audio streams.
2. **Build the Project**: 
   Open the project in Visual Studio and build the solution.

3. **Run the Application**: 
   Start the application and begin capturing audio for hotword detection.
